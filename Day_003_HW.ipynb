    "Objective Function that rewards the model for granting loans to those people who will pay them back, and would also impose fairness constraints that prevent it from unfairly denyling loans to certain protected groups of people.  \n",
    "In TFCO, the objective to minimize, and the constraints to impose, are represented as algebraic expressions (using normal Python operators) of simple basic rates.\n",
